Async Rouille

I like rouille and async code. This repo is a quick and dirty implementation to provide rouille API in async code. 

I would love to contribute to [tomaka/rouille](https://github.com/tomaka/rouille) project but it's already stable and the performance of my project is not high. I don't think that tomaka will like this.
